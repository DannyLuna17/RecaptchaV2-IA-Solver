# RecaptchaV2-IA-Solver
This project automates the process of solving Google reCAPTCHAs using the Undetected WebDriver and a deep learning model. The main highlight of the project is the integration of the YOLOv8x (You Only Look Once) object detection model for identifying and selecting the correct images in the ReCaptcha Images.
